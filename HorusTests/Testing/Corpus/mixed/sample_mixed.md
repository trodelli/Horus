3. Installation Guide

WARNING: Installation should be performed by qualified marine electronics technicians. Incorrect installation may result in equipment damage or unsafe operation.

3.1 Selecting a Mounting Location

Choose a location that provides:
- Clear visibility from the helm position
- Protection from direct sunlight when possible
- Adequate ventilation (minimum 3" clearance on all sides)
- Access to power source and transducer routing
- Distance from magnetic compasses (minimum 24" separation)

CAUTION: Do not mount the unit where it will be struck by opening hatches or swinging booms.

3.2 Display Unit Installation

Follow these steps in order:

1. Hold the mounting bracket against the selected location
2. Mark the four mounting hole positions with a pencil
3. Drill pilot holes using a 3/16" drill bit
4. For fiberglass installations, seal pilot holes with marine sealant[2]
5. Attach bracket using provided stainless steel screws
6. Allow sealant to cure for 24 hours before proceeding
7. Slide display unit into bracket until latch clicks
8. Verify unit is secure before connecting cables

3.3 GPS Antenna Installation

The GPS antenna must have an unobstructed view of the sky for optimal performance.

Recommended mounting locations:
- Flying bridge or hardtop
- Radar arch or mast
- Stern rail (for smaller vessels)

Avoid mounting near:
- VHF antennas (minimum 6-foot separation)
- Radar domes (minimum 5-foot separation)
- Large metal surfaces that may create multipath interference

Route the antenna cable through existing cable runs when possible. If drilling through deck or cabin, use appropriate marine deck fittings and seal all penetrations.

3.4 Depth Transducer Installation

The depth transducer can be mounted in three configurations:

Transom Mount (Recommended for most vessels):
- Install on hull centerline, 12-18" from stern
- Angle forward 5-10 degrees to reduce  turbulence
- Ensure sensor face is parallel to waterline when at rest
- Minimum water depth requirement: 2.5 feet

Through-Hull Mount (Best performance):
- Requires haul-out for installation
- Install forward of any struts or running gear
- Use marine-grade sealant on all threads
- Professional installation strongly recommended

In-Hull Mount (Fiberglass hulls only):
- No hull penetration required
- Reduced performance compared to through-hull
- Must be mounted in area with solid fiberglass layup
- Not suitable for cored hulls or vessels over 30 feet

3.5 Power Connection

1. Route power cable from display to battery or distribution panel
2. Connect red wire to positive (+) terminal
3. Connect black wire to negative (-) or ground terminal
4. Ensure inline fuse is rated correctly (5A fast-blow)
5. Route cables away from bilge pumps and other high-draw devices

IMPORTANT: The TideWatch Pro must be connected to a dedicated circuit breaker or fuse. Do not share power with VHF radios, autopilots, or other critical navigation equipment.

4. Operating Procedures

4.1 Initial Startup

Upon first power-up, the system will guide you through initial configuration:

- Select language (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian)
- Set units (Nautical/Statute miles, Fathoms/Feet/Meters)
- Configure depth alarm thresholds
- Enter vessel information (length, draft, beam)
- Perform GPS initialization (may take 5-15 minutes)

4.2 Understanding the  Display

The main navigation screen is divided into four quadrants:

Top Left: GPS position and course data
- Latitude/Longitude coordinates
- Course Over Ground (COG)
- Speed Over Ground (SOG)
- Time to destination (when waypoint active)

Top Right: Depth and sonar information
- Current depth reading
- Historical depth graph (last 5 minutes)
- Temperature (if equipped)
- Shallow water alarm indicator

Bottom Left: Chart display
- Current vessel position (blue triangle)
- Planned route (magenta line)
- Waypoints (yellow circles)
- Zoom level indicator

Bottom Right: Tide prediction
- Current tide height relative to Mean Lower Low Water
- Tide graph showing next 24 hours
- Time of next high/low tide
- Moon phase indicator

4.3 Creating a Navigation Route

To plan a route:

1. Tap the "Routes" icon on the main menu
2. Select "Create New Route"
3. Tap chart locations to add waypoints
4. Use zoom controls for precise placement
5. Name the route when prompted
6. Review route distance and estimated time
7. Tap "Save" to store route in memory
8. Select "Navigate" to activate route guidance

The system can store up to 50 routes with 50 waypoints each.

4.4 Setting Depth Alarms

Shallow water alarms help prevent groundings:

1. Press "Menu" → "Alarms" → "Depth"
2. Set "Shallow Water" alarm (recommended: draft + 3 feet)
3. Set "Deep Water" alarm if monitoring  channel depths
4. Enable "Anchor Drag" alarm for anchoring situations
5. Choose alarm sound (Beep, Chime, or Voice)

When an alarm is triggered, the display will flash red and emit the selected sound until acknowledged.

5. Troubleshooting

GPS Not Acquiring Position:
- Verify antenna has clear sky view
- Check antenna cable connections
- Wait up to 15 minutes for initial satellite lock
- Ensure antenna is not near VHF transmission sources during operation

Depth Reading Shows "---":
- Verify transducer cable connections
- Check that vessel is in water deep enough for reading (>2.5 feet)
- Inspect transducer face for fouling or damage
- Verify transducer type setting matches installed transducer

Display Won't Power On:
- Check circuit breaker/fuse
- Verify battery voltage is within 11-32V DC range
- Inspect power cable for damage
- Check connections at both display and power source

Erratic Depth Readings:
- Reduce vessel speed (turbulence affects accuracy)
- Check for marine growth on transducer face
- Verify transducer mounting angle
- Confirm transducer is not in turbulent water from props or through-hulls

6. Safety Warnings

⚠️ NAVIGATIONAL AID ONLY: The TideWatch Pro is intended as a supplementary navigation aid. Always maintain proper lookout and use traditional navigation methods in conjunction with electronic aids.

⚠️ TIDE PREDICTIONS: Tide data is based on mathematical models and historical observations. Actual conditions may vary due to weather,  barometric pressure, and local geography. Always verify with official tide tables.

⚠️ DEPTH ACCURACY: Depth readings may be affected by vessel speed, bottom composition, water salinity, and transducer installation. Always reference chart depths and maintain safe margins.

⚠️ CHART UPDATES: Electronic charts must be updated regularly. Using outdated charts may result in navigation hazards not being displayed. Check for updates monthly.

⚠️ BACKUP SYSTEMS: Maintain paper charts, compass, and traditional navigation tools as backup in case of electronic system failure.
