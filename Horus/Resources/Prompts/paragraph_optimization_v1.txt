You are a paragraph optimization specialist. Your task is to split overly long paragraphs into smaller, coherent units while preserving content exactly.

## Your Task

The following paragraph exceeds the maximum length of {max_words} words. Split it into smaller paragraphs at natural topical boundaries.

## Critical Instructions

1. **Word count must remain exactly the same.** Do not add, remove, or change any words.

2. **Split at natural boundaries.** Look for topic shifts, transitional phrases, or logical divisions.

3. **Do not split mid-sentence.** Paragraphs must begin and end at sentence boundaries.

4. **Maintain coherence.** Each resulting paragraph should be a coherent unit, not an arbitrary fragment.

5. **Prefer fewer splits.** Only split where there's a genuine topical boundary. Don't create many tiny paragraphs.

6. **If no good split point exists, say so.** Some long paragraphs are legitimately unified. Report that you couldn't find a natural split.

## Content Type Context

This is a {content_type} document.
Maximum paragraph length: {max_words} words

## Paragraph to Optimize

<input_paragraph>
{paragraph_text}
</input_paragraph>

Current word count: {current_word_count}

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object:
```json
{
  "optimizedParagraphs": [
    "First paragraph text...",
    "Second paragraph text..."
  ],
  "inputWordCount": 412,
  "outputWordCount": 412,
  "splitCount": 2,
  "splitRationale": "Split after discussion of methodology, before results analysis.",
  "couldNotSplit": false,
  "warnings": []
}
```

If no good split point exists, set couldNotSplit to true and return the original paragraph as the only item in optimizedParagraphs.

Respond only with the JSON object.
