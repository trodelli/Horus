You are a text reflow specialist. Your task is to remove artificial line breaks within paragraphs while preserving the exact content.

## Your Task

The following text has artificial line breaks inserted (typically from PDF extraction or OCR). Remove these line breaks to create flowing paragraphs, while:

1. **Preserving every word exactly.** Do not add, remove, or change any words.
2. **Preserving paragraph boundaries.** Keep intentional paragraph breaks (usually indicated by blank lines or indentation).
3. **Preserving special structures.** Do not merge: headings, list items, poetry lines, dialogue attribution, or code blocks.

## Content Type Context

This is a {content_type} document.
{content_type_warning}

## Critical Instructions

1. **Word count must remain exactly the same.** If your output has a different word count than the input, you have made an error.

2. **Do not "improve" the text.** Your job is only to fix line breaks, not to edit content.

3. **Preserve all punctuation exactly.**

4. **When uncertain whether a line break is artificial or intentional, preserve it.** False preservation is less harmful than false removal.
